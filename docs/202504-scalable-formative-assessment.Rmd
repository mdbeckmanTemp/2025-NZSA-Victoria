# Motivation

- Formative assessment intends to support learning; summative assessment intends to measure learning.
- **"Write-to-learn" tasks improve learning outcomes** (Graham, et al., 2020)
- Critical for citizen-statisticians to communicate effectively (Gould, 2010)
- Frequent practice w/ communicating improves statistical literacy and promotes retention (Basu, et al., 2013)
- **Formative assessment benefits both students & instructors** (Black & Wiliam, 2009; GAISE, 2016; Pearl, et al., 2012)

- A majority of U.S. undergraduates at public institutions take at least one large-enrollment STEM course (Supiano, 2022)
- **Logistics of constructed response tasks jeopardize use in large-enrollment classes** (Garfield & Ben-Zvi, 2008; Woodard & McGowan, 2012)

*Goal: Computer-assisted formative assessment feedback for short-answer tasks in large-enrollment classes, such that instructor burden is similar to small class (~30 students)*

<!-- Note: Automate the "copy / paste" workflow -->
<!-- Note: How good does the machine have to be?? -->
<!-- Note: as a statistician, I'm always comparing current circumstances of my data to some ideal state (SRS or randomized experiment) and negotiating compromise to achieve most desirable outcomes possible given the circumstances available. It's the same here--we want to create useful FA where there is (almost) none-->



# Research Questions

- **RQ1**: What level of agreement is achieved among trained human raters labeling (i.e., scoring) short-answer tasks?

- **RQ2**: What level of agreement is achieved between human raters and an NLP algorithm?

- **RQ3**: What sort of NLP representation leads to good clustering performance, and how does that interact with the classification algorithm?

# Meet the "machine": NLP for Assessment

- Natural language processing (NLP) involves how computers can be programmed to analyze language elements
- NLP-assisted feedback for educational use:
    - automated short-answer grading (ASAG) from 2009
    - essays & long-answer tasks earlier
- Human-machine collaboration is a promising mechanism to assist rapid, individualized feedback at scale (Basu, 2013)
- Deep neural networks application since 2016
- Relational (neural) networks



# Meet the "machine": Relational Networks

![Image credit: Becky Passonneau](RelationalNetwork_RJP.png)

- much of the architecture inspired by work from computer vision
- more efficient than transformer networks (e.g., LLMs)

Semantic Feature-Wise Transformation Relation Network (SFRN):

- end-to-end model with three components:
    - ($g_{\theta}MLP$) pretrained BERT encoder (LLM) >> vector representations
    - (+) learned feature-wise transformation function fuses multiple representations, if necessary (e.g., multiple reference answers)
    - ($f_{\phi}MLP$) is a classifier algorithm, i.e., neural network
- relation networks designed to learn generalizations that infer meaning in a data-efficient way
- data augmentation during training step

# Human-Machine Partnership?

Our approach to human-in-the-loop (HIL) did **not** make a recommendation (e.g., Left), it just shows examples to the human when it needs help (e.g., Right).

```



# Human-Machine Partnership Method

Want to evaluate accuracy of marking algorithm when designed to "defer" to human judgment

- algorithm evaluates a probability for each label (EC, PC, IC)
    - if a label has high probability, use algorithm label
    - if no label has sufficiently high probability, defer to human
- interests
    - estimate how frequently the algorithm defers
    - estimate accuracy of the combined process



# Human-Machine Partnership Results

> Our work is first that we know of to impelement controllable, selective prediction deferral policy for the classifier (i.e., scoring) step.

**RQ3**: What sort of NLP representation leads to good clustering performance, and how does that interact with the classification algorithm?


- Method: Rinse & repeat! 
    - Study the way instructors might do it and build tools to streamline at scale
    - How consistent are humans?

### Scoreboard (Final)

\small


- (RQ1) Instructor agreement ($\text{QWK} \approx 0.7 \text{ to } 0.8+$)  
- (RQ1) UTA agreement ($\text{QWK} \approx 0.6 \text{ to } 0.7+$)  
- (RQ2) NLP algorithm agreement with instructors ($\text{QWK} \approx 0.7+$)  
- (RQ2) Human-Algorithm partnership may be even better? ($\approx 0.85+$)  
- (RQ3) Clustering performance? (one of several avenues to pursue)  



# Discussion

- **RQ1**: Substantial agreement achieved among trained human raters provides context for further comparisons

- **RQ2**: NLP algorithm produced agreement reasonably aligned to results achieved by pairs/groups of trained human raters
    - Human-in-the-Loop >> Instructor / Algorithm partnership

- **RQ3**: Promising results based on "man-made clusters" but classification and clustering have competing incentives when it comes to dimensionality of NLP vector representations
    - Lower Dim is generally better for cluster stability
    - Higher Dim better for classification reliability
    - Feedback as a classifier (Li et al., 2023)
    - Exploring Topological Analysis as alternative to clustering
    - Comparative judgments for guided reflection as feedback



# Current Events

- challenge system with diverse tasks, institutions, student populations;
    - partnering with ISU, MSU, PSU, UCSB, UF, UTEP, & UoA
    - both "consensus" tasks & "local" tasks
    - approx 44,000 responses from ~ 13,000 students
    - targeting languistic diversity
- accumulated data to be shared with broader NLP community
    - this will be among the largest *open* data sources of it's kind
    - addresses barriers imposed by proprietary data sources on NLP research
- algorithm development 
    - contrastive loss function
    - accommodates more complex task structure
    - impact of response length 
    - studying influence of rubric features (Wei et al, in review)

# SFRN Detail (Li et al., 2021)

\small

SFRN is an end-to-end model with 3 components:

1. encode QRA triples producing vector representations for question (Q), a possible reference (R), and student answer (A)
2. when relation network includes multiple QRA triples, a learned feature-wise transformation network merges all relation vectors for a student answer into a single relation vector by leveraging attentions calculated by a QRA triple;
3. the resulting vector representation is passed as an input to a classifier (i.e., neural network)

![The $g_{\theta}MLP$ function (Left) uses an encoder to compute the relation vector for each [Q,R,A] triple. A
set of relation vectors is combined (+) using a fusion function (*SFT*). The $f_{\phi}MLP$ function is the classifier step.](SFRN.png){width=70%}

# Methods (RQ3): Humans

How similar is feedback provided by two instructors for some group of students?

- Two instructors independently evaluated 100 "partial credit" responses
- Each instructor provided free-text feedback to each student
- Verbatim feedback captured for each instructor and cross-tabulated for analysis.
- *Results:* 
    - The two instructors gave substantially equivalent feedback to 66 of 100 responses
    - Evidence of two large "clusters" (and quite a few singletons)


# Methods (RQ3): Machines

- Experiment #1 
    - retrain k-means & k-mediods clustering & evaluate stability
    - compare representations with higher & lower dimensionality
    - **Results:** 
        - SFRN (D = 512): cluster stability 0.62
        - Highest stability among competing algorithms was 0.88, achieved using a matrix factorization method that produces static representations (D = 50; WTMF; Guo & Diab, 2011)
        - *cursed*


- Experiment #2: 
    - ~~clustering~~ => FB Classifier?
    - Both Humans & Machines attempt
    - **Results:**
        - NLP Algorithm was more consistent with instructor A on one task and instructor B on the other task tested.
        - *meh*

- Reviewer 1 favored feedback on statistical concepts (only).
- Reviewer 2 provided same, plus a quote from the student
- Reviewer 2 parsed feedback to compare remarks related to the statistical concepts (only) with that of Reviewer 1.

# Results (RQ3 machines)

**RQ3**: What sort of NLP representation leads to good clustering performance, and how does that interact with the classification algorithm?

- SFRN (D = 512) produced reasonably consistent clusters when retrained (0.62)
- Highest consistency (0.88; D = 50) was achieved using a matrix factorization method that produces static representations (WTMF; Guo & Diab, 2011)

- AsRRN compared to humans (A & B) grouping students by pre-determined feedback categories:
