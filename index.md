### Evaluating NLP tools designed to assist instructors with formative assessment for large-enrollment STEM classes

*Abstract.* This talk seeks to articulate the benefit of free-response tasks and timely formative assessment feedback, a roadmap for developing human-in-the-loop natural language processing (NLP) assisted feedback, and results from a pilot study establishing proof of principle. If we are to pursue Statistics and Data Science Education across disciplines, we will surely encounter both opportunity and necessity to develop scalable solutions for pedagogical best practices. Research suggests that “write-to-learn” tasks improve learning outcomes, yet constructed-response methods of formative assessment become unwieldy when class sizes grow large. In the pilot study, several short-answer tasks completed by nearly 2000 introductory tertiary statistics students were evaluated by human raters and an NLP algorithm. After briefly describing the tasks, the student contexts, the algorithm and the raters, this talk discusses the results which indicate substantial inter-rater agreement and group consensus. The talk will conclude with recent developments building upon this pilot, as well as implications for teaching and future research.

Matt Beckman is an Associate Research Professor of Statistics at Penn State University, Director of the Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE), and 2025 NZSA Visiting Lecturer.  He is co-founder of a Statistics & Data Science Education Research Lab and affiliated faculty with the Social Science Research Institute and the Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence at Penn State. Matt's primary research interests tend to focus on assessment and he is currently PI for the NSF-funded "Project CLASSIFIES" which investigates the use of NLP tools to assist instructors of large-enrollment classes with providing formative assessment feedback on short-answer, free response tasks.
